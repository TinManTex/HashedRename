HashedRename
A tool for renaming files that have MGSV Qar/.dat hash names to their unhashed names and folders provided a dictionary. Useful for renaming files after a dictionary was updated.

Usage:
HashedRename <qar_dictionary path or files/folders to rename> <files/folders to rename>

If the first argument isn't the path to qar_dictionary.txt then HashedRename will try and read qar_dictionary.txt from the same folder it's exe is in.

A current qar_dictionary.txt can be found at https://github.com/TinManTex/mgsv-lookup-strings/tree/master/GzsTool
